        <h2>Hi, I'm Thato!</h2>
    
        <p>My story begins back when I was a kid. I had a burning desire to be creative and have a positive impact in the world's evolution and whilst most kids have some superhero complex desires when they are younger, they eventually outgrow it but NOT ME.  Growing up in Botswana, I became fascinated by how the internet connects people and ideas across the world and that curiosity slowly evoked my creative passion for building digital experiences.
          Web development felt like the perfect blend of creativity and problem solving. It gave me a way to turn ideas into something real, something people could see, use, and enjoy. </p>
    
        <p>My ambition as a developer is to build technology that solves real problems and helps people work smarter. Along with web development, I am working toward becoming a data analyst specialist who can guide organizations in using data for competitive advantage, efficiency, and customer satisfaction. By blending these skills, I hope to create digital experiences that are not only functional and creative but also driven by meaningful data insights.</p>

        <h3>When I'm Not Coding</h3>

        <p>Apart from rooting myself behind my computer coding, I am passionate about exploring art. Many at times I find myself at mountain tops and game reserves zoning into nature and asking myself "What is it that I can do to make this world fascinating than it already is?". I listen to music, locked in melodius tunes that activate my mind to think of ideas on how to tackle issues we face in our day to day life. </p>
