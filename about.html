        <h3>When I'm Not Coding</h3>

        <p>Apart from rooting myself behind my computer coding, I am passionate about exploring art. Many at times I find myself at mountain tops and game reserves zoning into nature and asking myself "What is it that I can do to make this world fascinating than it already is?". I listen to music, locked in melodius tunes that activate my mind to think of ideas on how to tackle issues we face in our day to day life. </p>
